# Monocular-Swarm


## Simulation:
So far primary edits are here: AirSim/PythonClient/multirotor

Tracking program "testball.py"
and controller "drone_controller.py" and "simplemoves.py"

## DJI Tello Implementation:
Mostly unchanged testball.py will be used for tello, with a modified drone_controller that
is able to control a dji tello edu drone.
